# Uppercut
## A boilerplate for creating sites with [Punch](https://github.com/laktek/punch)

This is just an evolution of my static site boilerplate called 25cents (one quarter to play) to work with Lakshan's awesome site generator.

The structure for 25cents follows [OOCSS](http://oocss.org/) and [SMACSS](http://smacss.com/) specifically. There are no set styles except for base.css which started out as [Normalize CSS](http://necolas.github.com/normalize.css/) but has been modified with my own code and other various techniques from around the web.
