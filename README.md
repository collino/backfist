# Backfist
## A boilerplate for creating sites with [Punch](https://github.com/laktek/punch)


This is just an evolution of my static site boilerplate called 25cents (one quarter to play) to work with Lakshan's awesome site generator.

The structure for 25cents follows [OOCSS](http://oocss.org/) concepts and [SMACSS](http://smacss.com/) file structure specifically. There are no default styles except for base.css which started out as [Normalize CSS](http://necolas.github.com/normalize.css/) but has been modified with my own code and other various techniques from around the web.

The HTML is just a mix of my own personal style, with cherry picked elements from all over.

(A backfist is performed by forming a fist and striking with the tops of the two largest knuckles)
